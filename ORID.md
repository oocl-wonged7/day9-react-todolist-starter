O:
Today, we explored the basics of React, focusing on the useContext and useReducer hooks. Additionally, we had a presentation on various design patterns, including the observer pattern, iterator pattern, state pattern, and strategy pattern. These sessions provided a comprehensive overview of essential concepts in both React and software design patterns. <br>

R:
I found the part about useContext and useReducer a bit challenging to follow since I hadn't learned these concepts before. However, it was a valuable opportunity to gain a basic understanding of different design patterns. <br>

I:
The difficulty I experienced with useContext and useReducer was primarily because these two hooks were new to me, making it hard to follow the lesson. Despite this, the session was beneficial as it provided a structured way to understand and connect various design patterns. <br>

D:
I planed to spend more time on reading the material related to the useContext and useReducer.<br>
